    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>QuizBuzz was born out of a deep passion for learning and a desire to create a fun and interactive platform for knowledge exploration. Inspired by my own journey as a lifelong learner, I wanted to develop a project that would not only challenge individuals intellectually but also foster a love for continuous learning.

The idea for QuizBuzz began during my time at Holberton School, where I was exposed to a diverse range of subjects and experienced firsthand the power of interactive learning. The project provided an opportunity to combine my technical skills with my enthusiasm for education.

This project serves as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, showcasing the culmination of my learning journey and the skills I've acquired. It is a testament to the dedication and commitment put into mastering the craft of software development.
